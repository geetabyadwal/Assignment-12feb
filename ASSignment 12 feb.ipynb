    "ANS=    An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, Python raises an error message to indicate that something unexpected happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of exceptions in Python, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "SyntaxError: Occurs when the syntax of a statement or expression is incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "NameError: Occurs when a variable or function name is not defined in the current scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "TypeError: Occurs when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.\n",
    "\n",
    "ValueError: Occurs when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value.\n",
    "\n",
    "IndexError: Occurs when trying to access an index that is out of range in a list or tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors occur during the parsing of code and are usually caught by the Python interpreter before the program runs. Exceptions, on the other hand, occur during program execution and can be caught and handled by the program code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference between exceptions and runtime errors is that runtime errors occur when a program violates a language or system-specific runtime constraint, such as dividing by zero, while exceptions are raised by the Python interpreter or program code when an error condition is encountered during program execution.\n",
